## STATUS

**Current phase:** Phase 5 — COMPLETE AND LIVE-TESTED (full GDV emergency flow → High Risk, persisted to Supabase). Phase 4 ingestion run still pending user PDFs (RAG runs empty for now; classification works on model knowledge). **Next: Phase 6 (Results page + Save to History).**
**Active plan:** `dev_plan.md`
**Next action:** Start Phase 6 — build `/assessment/[id]/results` (risk badge, first-aid, emergency contacts by state, disclaimer) + the "Save to History" button (sets `user_saved`). Then Phase 7 surfaces saved assessments on the dashboard/history.

## SESSION 1 — 2026-06-19 — Codex / GPT-5

### STARTED WITH
- Last session left off at: Phase 0, Task 0.1.
- Blockers from last session: none. User confirmed GitHub repo already exists at `https://github.com/cryptotweezer/pitsypet.git`.

### COMPLETED THIS SESSION
- [Task 0.1] — Confirmed Git remote points to `https://github.com/cryptotweezer/pitsypet.git`.
- [Task 0.2] — Created the Next.js 14 App Router project with TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, `src/`, and `@/*` alias.
- [Task 0.3] — Updated `.gitignore` to block env files, RAG sources, Python leftovers, and local dev-server logs.
- [Task 0.4] — Committed and pushed Phase 0 setup to `origin/main`.
- [Task 0.5] — Installed core runtime dependencies, including Vercel AI SDK v4 packages. Verified `ai@4.3.19`.
- [Task 0.6] — Installed Supabase CLI. Verified `supabase@2.107.0`.
- [Task 0.7] — Initialized shadcn/ui and added required base components.
- [Task 0.8] — Created `.env.example`; user confirmed all variables from the plan are saved locally in `.env.local`.
- [Task 0.9] — Created planned folder structure, `src/middleware.ts`, and `.gitkeep` files for empty directories.
- [Task 0.10] — Removed duplicate root `DEV_LOG.md`; `docs/DEV_LOG.md` is the only canonical session log.
- [Task 0.11] — User confirmed Vercel deployment is complete.
- [Task 0.12] — User confirmed all Vercel environment variables were added for the deployment.
- Verification — Confirmed `.env.local` is ignored by git and not tracked.
- Verification — `npm run lint` passes.
- Verification — `npm run build` passes with `.env.local` present.
- Verification — `npm run dev` starts and listens on `http://localhost:3000`.
- Verification — `npm ls ai @ai-sdk/anthropic @ai-sdk/openai @ai-sdk/react` confirms `ai@4.3.19`.
- Verification — `npx supabase --version` confirms `2.107.0`.

### IN PROGRESS (not finished)
- None for Phase 0.

### BLOCKED
- None for Phase 0.

### FILES MODIFIED
- `.gitignore` — Added secret/RAG/log ignore rules.
- `.env.example` — Added required environment variable template.
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` — Added Next.js project dependencies and Phase 0 packages.
- `components.json` — shadcn/ui configuration.
- `tailwind.config.ts` — Added shadcn theme tokens for Tailwind v3 compatibility.
- `src/app/globals.css` — shadcn theme CSS adjusted for Tailwind v3 build compatibility.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Updated metadata and removed unnecessary Google font dependency.
- `src/middleware.ts` — Added no-op middleware placeholder.
- `src/components/ui/*` — Added shadcn/ui base components.
- `src/**/.gitkeep`, `scripts/.gitkeep`, `supabase/migrations/.gitkeep` — Added planned folder structure placeholders.
- `DEV_LOG.md` — Removed duplicate root log pointer.
- `docs/DEV_LOG.md` — Updated status to Phase 0 complete and consolidated Phase 0 into one session entry.

### NEXT SESSION MUST START WITH
1. Start Phase 1, Task 1.1: create/configure the Supabase project if not already done.
2. Copy/confirm Supabase URL, anon key, and service role key in `.env.local`.
3. Run Supabase CLI initialization/linking and begin migrations from `dev_plan.md`.

### DECISIONS / NOTES
- Phase 0 is complete based on local verification plus user-confirmed Vercel deployment and Vercel env var configuration.
- `.env.local` remains local only and is correctly ignored.
- shadcn CLI latest generated Tailwind v4-style utilities; project remains on Tailwind v3 from `create-next-app@14`, so theme tokens were added manually and `outline-ring/50` was replaced with explicit CSS.

## SESSION 2 — 2026-06-19 — Codex / GPT-5

### STARTED WITH
- Last session left off at: Phase 0 complete.
- Blockers from last session: none.

### COMPLETED THIS SESSION
- [Task 1.1] — User confirmed Supabase project exists in Oceania/Sydney (`ap-southeast-2`).
- [Task 1.2] — User confirmed `.env.local` includes Supabase URL, anon key, and service role key.
- [Task 1.3] — Ran `npx supabase init` and linked the CLI to project ref `xaepzvxrqnqenspnanej`.
- [Task 1.4] — Created and applied all Phase 1 migrations to the remote Supabase project:
  `enable_extensions`, `profiles`, `breeds`, `pets`, `assessments`, `veterinary_knowledge`,
  `first_aid_and_emergency`, `knowledge_audit`, `indexes`, `vector_search_function`,
  `assessment_search_function`, and `rls_policies`.
- Generated `src/types/database.ts` from the linked remote schema.
- Added `scripts/verify-phase1.mjs` for service-role schema smoke checks without printing secrets.
- Verification — `npx supabase migration list` shows all 12 migrations applied locally and remotely.
- Verification — Remote smoke check returned `breeds = 53`, `emergency_contacts = 8`, and both RPC functions responded successfully.
- Verification — User manually verified RLS in Supabase Table Editor for all public tables. App-readable tables have active policies; `knowledge_processing_audit` has RLS enabled with no policies by design, creating deny-all behavior through PostgREST.
- Verification — `npm run lint` passes.
- Verification — `npm run build` passes.
- Decision — Supabase internal email is accepted temporarily for development so Phase 2 is not blocked.
- Decision — Resend/custom SMTP is deferred until production readiness.

### IN PROGRESS (not finished)
- Phase 1 deferred production hardening: configure/test Resend custom SMTP before production/UAT.
- Phase 1 deferred verification: signup trigger creates a row in `profiles` during Phase 2 auth testing.

### BLOCKED
- None blocking development.

### FILES MODIFIED
- `supabase/config.toml` — Supabase CLI local project configuration.
- `supabase/.gitignore` — Supabase local ignore rules for `.temp` and local env files.
- `supabase/migrations/*.sql` — Phase 1 schema, indexes, functions, seeds, and RLS policies.
- `src/types/database.ts` — Generated Supabase database types.
- `scripts/verify-phase1.mjs` — Remote schema smoke-check helper.
- `docs/DEV_LOG.md` — Updated Phase 1 progress.

### NEXT SESSION MUST START WITH
1. Start Phase 2, Task 2.1: install/create Supabase server, browser, and middleware helpers.
2. Build the auth routes/pages from `dev_plan.md`.
3. Verify signup creates a row in `profiles`.

### DECISIONS / NOTES
- Supabase CLI commands in this environment require `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` because of local TLS/certificate verification failures.
- The `supabase db push` warning about Docker/pg-delta cache did not block remote migration application.
- `supabase/migrations/.gitkeep` was removed because real migration files now exist and the CLI warned about the placeholder filename.
- RLS verified in all tables. The globe icon in Supabase's table list denotes the `public` schema. The `knowledge_processing_audit` dashboard warning is expected because it intentionally has no policies; this keeps internal RAG audit data inaccessible to normal `anon`/`authenticated` clients.
- Resend/custom SMTP remains the production target from the plan, but Supabase internal email is acceptable for development and Phase 2 implementation.

## SESSION 3 — 2026-06-19 — Claude / Opus 4.8 (Software Engineering review + hardening)

### STARTED WITH
- Last session left off at: Phase 1 complete for development; Phase 2 not started.
- Blockers from last session: none.
- Task this session: exhaustive engineering review of Phase 0 and Phase 1 before proceeding, then fix the problems found.

### REVIEW FINDINGS (Phase 0 + Phase 1)
- **Phase 1 (database): solid and faithful to the plan.** All 12 migrations match the spec; verified applied on remote (types generated with `--linked`; remote smoke check: `breeds=53`, `emergency_contacts=8`, both RPCs respond). The FTS index expression is byte-identical to `search_assessments` (index will be used); HNSW uses `vector_cosine_ops` matching the `<=>` operator; `search_assessments` is `SECURITY INVOKER` + `auth.uid()` + parameterized (injection-safe); RLS enabled on all 8 tables. The `::text` casts added to `search_veterinary_knowledge` were a correct, necessary fix (VARCHAR columns vs. `text` return signature).
- **Phase 0 (CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND): the shadcn UI kit was Tailwind v4 + Base UI, but the build ran Tailwind v3.** `shadcn@latest init` produced the "base-nova" style: every `src/components/ui/*` component imports `@base-ui/react` and uses v4-only class syntax (`gap-(--card-spacing)`, `--spacing(4)`, `max-h-(--available-height)`, `ring-3`, `data-open:`, `outline-hidden`, `@container`). Tailwind v3 silently ignores unknown utilities, so `npm run build` passed while most component styling produced **no CSS at all** — a false green. This would have surfaced as broken-looking forms/dialogs/selects in Phases 2/3/5.
- Other gaps: `form` shadcn component missing (needed Phases 2/3); `react-hook-form`/`@hookform/resolvers` not installed; `updated_at` never auto-updated (no trigger); signup trigger could fail a registration on duplicate; `dev_plan.md` header stale.

### COMPLETED THIS SESSION
- **Migrated the build pipeline to Tailwind v4** to match the already-generated v4/Base UI component kit (the coherent fix vs. rewriting 12 components for v3):
  - Installed `tailwindcss@4.3.1` + `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.3.1`; removed the `shadcn` runtime dependency (CLI only, used via `npx`).
  - Rewrote `postcss.config.mjs` to use `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
  - Rewrote `src/app/globals.css` to clean v4 structure: `@import "tailwindcss"` + `@import "tw-animate-css"`, `@custom-variant dark`, and an `@theme inline` block mapping all color/radius/font tokens to the existing oklch `:root`/`.dark` variables. Removed the `@import "shadcn/tailwind.css"` runtime-coupling hack.
  - Deleted the v3 `tailwind.config.ts` (v4 is CSS-first) and set `components.json` `tailwind.config` to `""`.
  - **Verified the fix:** inspected the compiled CSS in `.next/static/css` and confirmed component utilities now emit real rules (`bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`, `bg-popover`, `ring-foreground`, `border-input`, `animate-in`, `fade-in-0`, `zoom-in-95`, `slide-in-from-top-2`, `outline-hidden`).
- **Added form infrastructure** for Phases 2/3: installed `react-hook-form@7.79.0` + `@hookform/resolvers@5.4.0`; created `src/components/ui/form.tsx` (self-contained, wraps RHF, uses the local `Label`, no extra primitive dependency).
- **Database hardening (2 new migrations, applied to remote):**
  - `20260619001300_updated_at_triggers.sql` — `set_updated_at()` BEFORE UPDATE trigger on `profiles` and `pets` (assessments has no `updated_at` column).
  - `20260619001400_harden_new_user.sql` — `handle_new_user()` now uses `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING` so a duplicate profile cannot roll back a signup.
  - `npx supabase migration list` confirms all 14 migrations applied local + remote.
- **Docs:** updated `dev_plan.md` header (status + Tailwind v4 stack note) and this DEV_LOG.
- **Verification:** `npm run lint` → 0 errors; `npm run build` → success, 0 TS errors.

### IN PROGRESS (not finished)
- None.

### BLOCKED
- None.

### FILES MODIFIED
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` — +tailwindcss@4, +@tailwindcss/postcss, +react-hook-form, +@hookform/resolvers; -shadcn.
- `postcss.config.mjs` — switched to `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
- `src/app/globals.css` — rewritten for Tailwind v4 (@theme inline + tokens).
- `components.json` — `tailwind.config` set to `""` (v4).
- `tailwind.config.ts` — deleted (v4 is CSS-first).
- `src/components/ui/form.tsx` — new form component.
- `supabase/migrations/20260619001300_updated_at_triggers.sql` — new.
- `supabase/migrations/20260619001400_harden_new_user.sql` — new.
- `docs/dev_plan.md` — header/status + stack note.
- `docs/DEV_LOG.md` — this entry.

### NEXT SESSION MUST START WITH
1. Begin Phase 2, Task 2.1: create `src/lib/supabase/{client,server,middleware}.ts`.
2. Build the real `src/middleware.ts` (currently a no-op placeholder) per the canonical `@supabase/ssr` pattern.
3. **First end-to-end check in Phase 2:** confirm a real signup creates a `profiles` row via the (now hardened) `handle_new_user` trigger — this is the one Phase 1 "Done When" item that can only be verified with a live signup.

### DECISIONS / NOTES
- **Stack decision:** committed to **Tailwind v4 + shadcn base-nova (Base UI)**. Rationale: the components were already authored for v4/Base UI and `shadcn@latest` keeps generating them that way, so aligning the build to v4 is lower-risk and forward-compatible than rewriting every component to v3/Radix. Do NOT add `tailwindcss-animate` or a v3 `tailwind.config.ts` back; this project is CSS-first v4.
- `lucide-react@1.21.0` and `@base-ui/react@1.6.0` resolved and build is green; left as-is. Worth a sanity check against the public registry if any icon/component import ever fails.
- Supabase CLI still needs `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` in this environment; the Docker/pg-delta catalog warning on `db push` is non-blocking (local edge-runtime image only).
- Still deferred from Phase 1 (unchanged, pre-production): Resend custom SMTP (task 1.5).

## SESSION 4 — 2026-06-19 — Claude / Opus 4.8 (Phase 2: Authentication)

### STARTED WITH
- Last session left off at: Phase 0+1 reviewed/hardened; Phase 2 not started.
- Blockers from last session: none.

### COMPLETED THIS SESSION (all of Phase 2)
- [Task 2.1] — Supabase client utilities: `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` (browser) and `server.ts` (cookie-scoped, RLS-enforced, no service-role).
- [Task 2.2] — Session-refresh middleware: `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` (calls `getUser()` to refresh tokens + route guards) and real `src/middleware.ts` (replaced the no-op placeholder).
- [Task 2.3] — Auth callback: `src/app/(auth)/auth/callback/route.ts` (`exchangeCodeForSession` → /dashboard, or /login?error on failure).
- [Task 2.4] — Register page + `components/auth/register-form.tsx` (RHF + zod; name 2–100, email, password 8+ with upper/lower/number/special, optional AU state via Base UI Select). Handles Supabase's anti-enumeration duplicate case (empty `identities` array → "Email already registered").
- [Task 2.5] — Login page + `components/auth/login-form.tsx` (signInWithPassword → /dashboard; "Invalid email or password").
- [Task 2.6] — Protected layout `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx` (getUser guard) + `components/shared/navbar.tsx` (email + logout).
- [Task 2.7] — Placeholder `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` ("Welcome, [name]" reading `profiles`).
- Added `src/lib/constants.ts` (AU_STATES, reused in Phase 6 for emergency contacts).
- Removed redundant `.gitkeep` files from directories that now hold real files.

### VERIFICATION — all Phase 2 "Done When" items PASS
- `npm run lint` → 0 errors; `npm run build` → 0 TS errors.
- Runtime (curl): `/login` 200, `/register` 200, `/dashboard` with no session → 307 to `/login`.
- **Live test by user (Andres):** register → magic-link email → /dashboard "Welcome, Andres felipe Henao"; **`profiles` row auto-created with name + state (confirms the `handle_new_user` trigger — the last deferred Phase 1 item)**; logout → /login; sign in → /dashboard; **re-register same email → "Email already registered"**; visiting `/login` while logged in → auto-redirect to /dashboard.

### PRODUCTION VERIFICATION (Vercel)
- Latest deployment = Phase 2 commit `9142517`, state READY, target production. Build passed.
- `https://pitsypet.vercel.app/login` renders 200 with correct Tailwind v4 styling; `/dashboard` unauthenticated redirects to `/login` (proves Supabase env vars set in Production + middleware runs in prod).
- Added `https://pitsypet.vercel.app/**` to Supabase Auth → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs (was empty; Site URL still localhost). Without this the prod magic link would fall back to localhost.
- **Live prod test by user:** registered a new account on production → magic-link email → landed on the production /dashboard → new user + profiles row visible in Supabase. Phase 2 auth confirmed end to end in production.

### DEFERRED (not blocking Phase 3)
- Production session test (expired-token auto-refresh) — per plan, verified at Phase 11 deployment.
- Resend custom SMTP (Phase 1 task 1.5) — still using Supabase built-in email for dev.
- **Vercel Deployment Protection: DISABLED this session.** The production site is now publicly accessible (verified: `https://pitsypet.vercel.app/login` returns the app's "Welcome back" page to anonymous visitors, not the Vercel auth gate).

### FILES MODIFIED
- New: `src/lib/supabase/{client,server,middleware}.ts`, `src/app/(auth)/auth/callback/route.ts`, `src/components/auth/{register-form,login-form}.tsx`, `src/app/(auth)/{register,login}/page.tsx`, `src/components/shared/navbar.tsx`, `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`, `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/lib/constants.ts`.
- Changed: `src/middleware.ts` (real session middleware).

### NEXT SESSION MUST START WITH
1. Phase 3, Task 3.1: pets API routes (`src/app/api/pets/route.ts`, `[id]/route.ts`, `breeds/route.ts`) using the cookie-scoped server client.
2. Then pet-form + breed-autocomplete components, dashboard pet list, create/edit pages.

### DECISIONS / NOTES
- A stale `next dev` from an earlier session was left running on port 3000 and corrupted `.next` (mixed dev/prod chunks → "Cannot find module './948.js'"). Fix: kill the port-3000 process, `rm -rf .next`, rebuild. Don't leave a dev server running across sessions.
- Supabase Select for the State field uses the Base UI API (`value`/`onValueChange`/`SelectValue placeholder`), not Radix.
---

---
## SESSION 5 — 2026-06-20 — Claude / Opus 4.8 (Phase 3: Pet Profile Management + token-budget protocol)

### STARTED WITH
- Last session left off at: Phase 2 complete/verified; Phase 3 not started.
- Blockers from last session: none.

### COMPLETED THIS SESSION
- **Session-startup token budget (workflow change):** rewrote `CLAUDE.md` with a "Session bootstrap" protocol — read only the latest DEV_LOG entry + the *current phase's* section of `dev_plan.md` (Grep + ranged Read), NOT the whole plan (~47K tokens via the real tokenizer; `chars/4` underestimates badly because of SQL/code/tables). Added a 12-phase **Project roadmap** table with live status + cross-phase "keep in mind" notes, and a requirement to reply with a 2–3 line bootstrap summary each session. Arranque ~57K → ~7–9K tokens. No content lost: cross-cutting invariants already live in CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded).
- **Placeholder landing page** (`src/app/page.tsx`): replaced the Next.js boilerplate with a minimal PitsyPet home (name + tagline + Register/Login buttons + footer disclaimer). Marked in-code as a placeholder; Phase 8 task 8.1 polishes it.
- **Phase 3 — all tasks:**
  - [3.1] Pets API (cookie-scoped client, RLS): `api/pets/route.ts` (GET list non-deleted, POST create → **409 on `UNIQUE(user_id, pet_name)` / pg code 23505**), `api/pets/[id]/route.ts` (PATCH update, DELETE = **soft delete** `deleted_at = now()`), `api/pets/breeds/route.ts` (autocomplete via trigram index, authenticated-read).
  - [3.2] `components/pets/pet-form.tsx` — RHF + Zod (`mode: onChange`, submit disabled until valid), Dog/Cat toggle, numeric inputs, medical-conditions tag input (max 10). Serves both create and edit.
  - [3.3] `components/pets/breed-autocomplete.tsx` — 200ms debounce, keyboard nav (↑↓/Enter/Esc), custom-breed option, clears on species change.
  - [3.4] `components/pets/pet-card.tsx` — species icon, age/weight, condition badges, Start Assessment / Edit / Delete (confirm Dialog).
  - [3.5] Dashboard rewritten: pet grid + empty state.
  - [3.6/3.7] `pets/new` and `pets/[id]/edit` pages (edit pre-fetches with ownership via RLS, `notFound()` otherwise).
  - Shared `src/lib/validations/pet.ts` — single source of truth for weight bounds (Dog 0.5–120, Cat 0.3–15), age limits, max conditions; exports both a string-based form schema and a coerced API schema + a `formValuesToApiInput` mapper.
  - Mounted the sonner `<Toaster />` in `(app)/layout.tsx` (was never mounted).

### VERIFICATION — Phase 3 "Done When" PASS (live-tested by user)
- `npm run lint` → 0; `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0; `npm run build` → success (all new routes compiled).
- Live: empty state → add pet → card appears + row in Supabase; second pet (cat) added (2 pets under one user_id); **cat weight 100kg rejected** by species validation; **duplicate name → 409**; delete → disappears from dashboard, row remains in Supabase with `deleted_at` set (soft delete confirmed).

### DEFERRED (not blocking Phase 4)
- **[Phase 3 Done-When] "first pet → /assessment/[petId]" redirect** deferred to Phase 5: that route doesn't exist yet, so create currently redirects to /dashboard. `TODO(Phase 5)` left in `pet-form.tsx`.
- **Soft-delete vs UNIQUE constraint edge case:** a soft-deleted pet name still trips the 409 on re-create (the row persists). Would need a partial unique index excluding `deleted_at IS NOT NULL`. Logged for later; not in Phase 3 scope.
- Resend custom SMTP (Phase 1 task 1.5); expired-token session refresh test (Phase 2 → Phase 11). Unchanged.

### FILES MODIFIED
- New: `src/lib/validations/pet.ts`, `src/app/api/pets/{route.ts,[id]/route.ts,breeds/route.ts}`, `src/components/pets/{pet-form,breed-autocomplete,pet-card}.tsx`, `src/app/(app)/pets/new/page.tsx`, `src/app/(app)/pets/[id]/edit/page.tsx`.
- Changed: `src/app/page.tsx` (placeholder landing), `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` (pet list), `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx` (+Toaster), `CLAUDE.md` (bootstrap protocol + roadmap + status), `docs/dev_plan.md` (header status).

### NEXT SESSION MUST START WITH
1. Phase 4, Task 4.1: `src/lib/ai/embed.ts` (shared OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` helper — used by both ingestion and the Phase 5 runtime).
2. Then `scripts/chunk.ts` (token chunker), collect openly-licensed sources into `scripts/sources/` (gitignored), write + run `scripts/ingest.ts`.
3. Remember: ingestion is the ONLY place `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is used; never import it into `src/`.

### DECISIONS / NOTES
- Soft delete is intentional (assessments FK `pet_id ON DELETE CASCADE` — a hard delete would cascade-wipe history). Dashboard and all queries filter `deleted_at IS NULL`.
- Pet field shape (species/breed/age_years/age_months/weight_kg/medical_conditions) is consumed verbatim by Phase 5 `formatPet` + RAG query — kept stable.
- Numeric form fields are kept as strings in the RHF schema (matches the existing register-form style) and coerced at the API boundary via `petApiSchema`, avoiding RHF/Zod number-generic friction.

## SESSION 6 — 2026-06-20 — Claude / Opus 4.8 (Phase 4: RAG ingestion pipeline)

### STARTED WITH
- Last session left off at: Phase 3 complete/verified.
- Blockers from last session: none. User does NOT yet have veterinary source documents.

### COMPLETED THIS SESSION (Phase 4 pipeline — code only; ingestion run deferred)
- [Task 4.1] `src/lib/ai/embed.ts` — shared OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` helper (`embedText`, `embedBatch`, `buildRagQuery`), per the plan verbatim. Imported by ingestion now and the Phase 5 runtime later (one code path, no skew).
- [Task 4.2] `scripts/chunk.ts` — `cleanText` (de-noises PDF extraction) + `chunkText` (~400-token windows, ~50 overlap) via `js-tiktoken` `cl100k_base`.
- [Task 4.4] `scripts/ingest.ts` — reads `scripts/sources/` (PDF/txt/md), extracts text (PDF via `pdf-parse/lib/pdf-parse.js`), chunks, assigns metadata heuristically (species default 'Both'; urgency 3/6/9 by keyword; body_system keyword map; breed_specific flag), embeds in batches of 96, inserts into `veterinary_knowledge` in batches of 100 (embedding stored as pgvector string literal `[...]`), writes one `knowledge_processing_audit` row per file, logs progress. Manual `.env.local` loader into `process.env` (no dotenv dep). Service-role client typed with `Database`.
- Added `pdf-parse` (devDependency) + `scripts/pdf-parse.d.ts` ambient types for the `/lib` subpath (avoids the package's debug-on-import wrapper). Added `npm run ingest`.
- Created `scripts/sources/` (gitignored) with a local-only README telling the user where to drop docs.

### VERIFICATION
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors (scripts ARE type-checked: tsconfig `include: **/*.ts`); `npm run lint` → 0; `npm run build` → success.
- NOT yet verified: an actual ingestion run (needs source PDFs + an OpenAI call + writes to remote Supabase). The Phase 4 "Done When" data checks (>500 rows, ≥3 sources, body_system spread, audit rows) remain OPEN until the user supplies documents and we run `npm run ingest`.

### BLOCKED
- [Task 4.3 / 4.5] Collecting openly-licensed veterinary sources and running ingestion — BLOCKED on the user. Drop PDFs/.txt into `scripts/sources/`, then run `npm run ingest`.

### FILES MODIFIED
- New: `src/lib/ai/embed.ts`, `scripts/chunk.ts`, `scripts/ingest.ts`, `scripts/pdf-parse.d.ts`.
- Changed: `package.json`/`package-lock.json` (+pdf-parse, +ingest script), `docs/DEV_LOG.md`, `docs/dev_plan.md` (header), `CLAUDE.md` (roadmap status).
- Local-only (gitignored): `scripts/sources/` + README.

### NEXT SESSION MUST START WITH
1. If docs are ready: drop them in `scripts/sources/`, run ingestion, verify the Phase 4 "Done When" data checks, then mark Phase 4 ✅.
2. Otherwise, Phase 4 can stay open and Phase 5 (AI triage engine) can begin — RAG degrades gracefully on 0 chunks (classification proceeds without context).

### DECISIONS / NOTES
- Metadata labels (species/urgency/body_system) are re-rank signals ONLY, never retrieval gates — heuristics are deliberately conservative (species defaults to 'Both' so a chunk is never hidden by a mislabel).
- `pdf-parse` pulls in old transitive deps with audit warnings; it's a dev-only ingestion tool (never bundled/deployed), so acceptable. PDF text extraction can be messy for multi-column layouts — `cleanText` mitigates, but curated `.txt` gives the cleanest chunks.
- **TLS issue SOLVED this session (properly, no longer disabling verification).** Diagnosed the root cause: **Norton** Web/Mail Shield intercepts HTTPS and re-signs with `Norton Web/Mail Shield Root`, which Node didn't trust (`UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE`). Fix: set user-level `NODE_OPTIONS=--use-system-ca` (Node v22 → trusts the Windows cert store, where Norton's root already lives). Verified `scripts/verify-phase1.mjs` (real supabase-js → remote) passes with NO `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`. New terminals inherit it automatically. The old insecure flag should no longer be used anywhere. (Supabase CLI is a separate Go binary that uses the Windows store natively; re-check only if a future `db push` complains.)

## SESSION 7 — 2026-06-20 — Claude / Opus 4.8 (Phase 5: AI Triage Engine — the core)

### STARTED WITH
- Last session left off at: Phase 4 pipeline built (ingestion pending docs).
- Decision: build Phase 5 in parallel (RAG degrades gracefully with 0 chunks).

### COMPLETED THIS SESSION (all of Phase 5)
- **Engine core (committed first as part 1):** `schemas.ts` (5.1), `safety.ts` (5.2, escalate-only override), `rag.ts` (5.3, embed→vector search→quality filter→urgency re-rank→source-diverse top 5, returns [] on failure), `classifier.ts` (5.4, Sonnet generateObject → parse-retry → rule fallback → safety override last), `fallback.ts` (5.5, severity scoring, rounds up, conf 0.65), `format.ts` (5.7), `rate-limit.ts` + `cost-guard.ts` (5.6).
- **Validation (5.14):** `scripts/spike-triage.ts` (`npm run spike`) — 10 scenarios, all 5 emergencies → High; uncertain cases round up. Ran live against Sonnet: PASS.
- **Streaming + routes + UI (part 2):**
  - [5.8] `api/assessment/chat/route.ts` — `createDataStreamResponse` + `streamText` Haiku, one `record_symptoms` tool, `maxSteps:1`; symptoms streamed to client via `writeData`; `onFinish` runs RAG + Sonnet classify + safety override and persists everything in one write (survives client disconnect). Cost-guard (503) + per-user rate-limit (429) + pet re-fetch via RLS.
  - [5.9] `api/assessment/route.ts` (POST create), `[id]/route.ts` (GET), `[id]/save/route.ts` (POST set user_saved).
  - [5.10] `(app)/assessment/[petId]/page.tsx` — creates a fresh assessment row, renders chat.
  - [5.11–5.13] `chat-interface.tsx` (useChat, bubbles, quick-replies, inline result), `symptom-sidebar.tsx`, `progress-indicator.tsx`.

### VERIFICATION
- `tsc` 0, `lint` 0, `build` success. Spike: all emergencies High.
- **LIVE TEST (user):** new pet → Start Assessment → AI greets by name → multi-turn extraction with one follow-up/turn + quick-reply buttons (user liked these) → full GDV scenario (vomiting/weakness/swollen belly + retching) → **High Risk** with detailed clinical reasoning → row saved in Supabase. Core product works end to end.

### NOT YET VERIFIED (optional Done-When robustness checks — deferred, not blocking)
- Disconnect test (close tab mid-analysis → row still classified via onFinish).
- Fallback test (fake ANTHROPIC_API_KEY → completes via rule-based fallback).

### DEFERRED TO LATER PHASES (by design)
- **Phase 6:** inline result panel in chat is a placeholder — replace with `/assessment/[id]/results` page + "Save to History" button (`TODO(Phase 6)` in `chat-interface.tsx`). Symptom sidebar is a persistent panel, not a Sheet (minor, intentional).
- **Phase 7:** no way to browse a past assessment from the dashboard yet (history list + search). User noticed this — it's the next-next phase.

### FILES MODIFIED
- New: `src/app/api/assessment/{route.ts,chat/route.ts,[id]/route.ts,[id]/save/route.ts}`, `src/app/(app)/assessment/[petId]/page.tsx`, `src/components/assessment/{chat-interface,symptom-sidebar,progress-indicator}.tsx`. (Engine libs landed in the part-1 commit.)
- Changed: `CLAUDE.md` (roadmap), `docs/dev_plan.md` (header), `docs/DEV_LOG.md`.

### NEXT SESSION MUST START WITH
1. Phase 6, Task 6.1: `(app)/assessment/[id]/results/page.tsx` + risk-badge / clinical-reasoning / recommendations / disclaimer components; switch the chat to redirect there on completion.
2. Seed `first_aid_recommendations` (migration 6.7), regenerate types.

### DECISIONS / NOTES
- `maxSteps:1` + one tool: Haiku reliably emits BOTH the follow-up question (streamed text) AND the `record_symptoms` tool call per turn — verified live, follow-ups appear as expected.
- RAG ran empty (KB not ingested); classification still produced strong results from model knowledge — confirms the graceful-degradation design. Quality should improve once Phase 4 ingestion runs.
- Result is shown inline for now so Phase 5 is testable without the Phase 6 results page (mirrors the Phase 3 first-pet-redirect deferral).
